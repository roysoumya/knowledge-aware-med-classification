### Directory Structure
* Text Classification: This directory consists of the codes used for Medical Text Classification. They were trained using the train set and evaluated using the test set provided in the data directory. It is splitted into the following three directories for comfort in understanding the usage of the codes:
  * BERT Models: It consists the codes of BERT, BERT plus Med and the McNemar's test on the BERT model.
  * Baseline Models: It consists the codes for basic Machine Learning Models and Heirarchical Attention Network. The Machine Learning Models used were Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. For taking care of the imbalance in the datasets we used SMOTE. The Hierarchichal Attention network was used for extracting the Word and Sentence Attentions of various datapoints.
