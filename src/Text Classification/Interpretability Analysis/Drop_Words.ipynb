adhd as a comorbid condition at 10 years he has been having seizures since he was 3 he has speech language delay poor attention poor social thinking and limited interests and he struggles with reading he is better at math he simply can not plan and start a project remember the details and complete the task he is in a partially mainstreamed special education program he is 10 years old now he has had 3 grandmals so far and about 2 3 complex partial seizure episides per year he has taken iq tests at 5 years and at 7 years from the school and from neuropsycologists all 4 tests revealed below average range around 87 for intelligence and mild impairment for executive cognitive skills he did pretty well in school for the last two years he was bright and happy to participate he had started blooming really well his meds were changed in april to get better seizure control we got seizure control but the side effects were bad it feels as if his asd and adhd issues have worsened the school year had barely started they administered a series of tests including kaufman assesment battery for children 2nd edition first of all it takes him 15 minutes to just sit and start working on a problem he knows how to do it takes him a lot more time to warm up to a new unpredictable situation and give his undivided attention on top of it he is not good at responding to open ended questions due to his communication problems he is better at multiple choice questions and visual questions when i expressed all these concerns the district said it was just a routine test anyways they say that his iq has dropped to 60 the only thing that has changed since the last test was that he was hospitalized from a grand mal 2 years back which was treated immediately and no long term issues cropped up from that it was confirmed by a series of medical tests i have 3 questions 1 given the list of issues attention language asd and low motivation my son has has the school administered the right iq test 2 can iq drop so significantly 3 are there alternate iq tests for kids with asd and adhd also should i just take the iq test results with a grain of salt and continue working with him as usual my only worry is that his already low bar at school will be lowered even more his teacher has already stopped sending him to science and art classes because he can not handle them he had started enjoying learning

scraping like skratch like a dragging of the two tissues against eachother and it is quiet painful it only happens during a couple steps that i take and it fades away when i slow down my walking this

check realizations to keep in mind 1 if mainstream medicine really worked then drug companies would not have to commit scientific fraud to fake their clinical trials would they 2 if mainstream medicine really worked then doctors drugs companies and the fda would not be afraid of competition from nutritional supplements and natural remedies and they would not keep trying to censor or outlaw those natural remedies 3 if mainstream medicine really worked drug companies would gladly test their drugs side by side with nutritional remedies to see what works best http www naturalnews com 028473_z 4 if mainstream medicine really worked health insurance costs would be extremely low the only reason health insurance costs so much is because mainstream medicine does not cure anybody and patients stay sick which costs more money to keep treating 5 if mainstream medicine really worked then all the other countries in the world would be looking at the u s health care system and saying wow we want that 6 if mainstream medicine really worked drug companies would be out of business because virtually everybody would be healthy and therefore not need drugs on an ongoing basis 7 if mainstream medicine really worked doctors would largely put themselves out of business by teaching patients how to take care of their own health 8 if mainstream medicine really worked drug companies like johnson johnson would not have to pay kickbacks bribes to nursing homes to entice them to push more of their drugs onto helpless senior citizens 9 if mainstream medicine really worked the treatment of teenagers with chemotherapy would not have to be enforced by court order with the threat of arrest and imprisonment of the parents as happens in the u s today http www naturalnews com abraham_ 10 if mainstream medicine really worked drug companies would not need to advertise on television to persuade people to take drugs they do not need now to hear mainstream medicine pushers say it the only reason americans are so sick and diseased right now is because get this not enough people are taking enough medications yes if they could only convince more parents to drug more babies and toddlers or if they could get more teens on four five or six drugs at once or if they could convince nursing homes to pop a dozen different meds into the mouths of senior citizens then we would all be healthier america you see suffers from a medication deficiency that the line of mainstream medicine more meds less disease and now they are trying to convince everyone that even healthy people now need meds statin drugs even if they show no symptoms of disease so now get this being healthy is no longer enough to avoid medications we are all supposed to be medicated whether we are healthy or not mainstream medicine you see is not satisfied to just treat sick people with its medications radiation machines and surgical procedures it wants to put all the healthy people on pills too and what will be the result of all this imagine in your own mind for a moment what will be the result if say americans start taking twice as much medication as they do right now will americans be healthier of course not they will be more diseased more medicated and chemically contaminated the fish downstream will be even more polluted with pharmaceutical runoff and the bio sludge human waste compost products now being put on farms will be even more heavily saturated with medication chemicals will that create health for america of course not mainstream medicine does not work and pushing mainstream medicine onto more people will only cause more sickness more suffering and more bankruptcies across american households it will however accomplish one very important thing the obscene financial enrichment of a few powerful corporations like pfizer merck johnson johnson and astrazeneca and that my friends is the entire point of mainstream medicine to mainline the profits for big pharma sideline the legitimate health problems of the american people and streamline the criminal soaking of the rich the poor and the recently insured in order to turn sickness into profit that mainstream

flying majestically soaring high in the sky the other bird had not moved from its branch since the day it had arrived the king summoned healers and sorcerers from all the land to tend to the falcon but no one could make the bird fly he presented the task to the member of his court but the next day the king saw through the palace window that the bird had still not moved from its perch having tried everything else the king thought to himself may be i need someone more familiar with the countryside to understand the nature of this problem so he cried out to his court go and get a farmer in the morning the king was thrilled to see the falcon soaring high above the palace gardens he said to his court bring me the doer of this miracle the court quickly located the farmer who came and stood before the king the king asked him how did you make the falcon fly with his head bowed the farmer said to the king it was very easy your highness i simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting we are all made to fly to realize our incredible potential as human beings but instead of doing that we sit on our branches clinging to the things that are familiar to us the possibilities are endless but for most of us they remain undiscovered we conform to the familiar the comfortable the mundane so for the most part our lives are mediocre instead of exciting thrilling and fulfilling so let us

boy for 1 00 of course the boy can not seem to find it so i will not get this back the boy mother believes the boy when he told her that my daughter kept pesting him for the trade my daughter tells me that he was the one coaxing her to get the necklace i believe her she has been trading expensive items with this same boy quite often in which i made her go to his house and get her items back the mother said she was not aware of all of the trading going on first i want to say i thought i was a good mother my kids never went without anything for the most part they have more than most of their

stressed you do not want to let down your family and you do not want to be viewed as weak or a wimp by your buddies you summon the courage to overcome the stigma and you go to your local department of veterans affairs to get some help you file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you have earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially you are

believe after 10 years of war three va secretaries and an increase in the overall department budget of 40 since 2009 an incredible 97 of veteran claims are still on paper yep paper america has soldiers in nevada piloting drones remotely that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away but 97 of our veterans benefits claims are still on paper earlier this month the center for investigative reporting released a leaked internal va document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years the va backlog problem is even worse than reported the va has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days for the first claim filed it longer 316 to 327 days in los angeles that figure is 619 in new york it 642 in indianapolis it 612 days and vets with first time claims in reno nevada wait 681 days the va has testified that it has hired 3 300 new claims processors but it has failed to report that because of staff turnover the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010 and in chicago waco texas and oakland california the overall number of claims processors has gone down since the internal documents were leaked last week we have yet to see a public response from va secretary eric shinseki or from the commander in chief some 2 6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in iraq and afghanistan but now a decade later president barack obama is not answering their calls for help and the public still does not seem to get it that why this week i am joining veterans from across america as we take our stories to

them more harm than good i have found myself wrecking my brain over whether i should keep this thing in or take it out i have start thinking crazy thoughts like what if i die and my baby is left motherless or what if i can never conceive again does that not sound depressing well other than what i have mentioned i do not think i am so depressed that i need antidepressants i am just trying to

or poop in it then fling it around the room and ripped the pages out of every book he had and before someone says it i did take the toys and books and even the clothing out of his room this resulted in him using his fingernails and peeling off the paint on the walls then at one point tore open his pillow and ripped apart his blankets therepist decided we needed to see the doctor she too said all of the things the psychologist did with the addition of insomnia which i too suffer severely from saw the doctor doctor gave us 4 medications to research in case we changed our minds on medicating our 3 year old which we did eventually change our minds on he was put on ritalin worked our way up to 25mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening he was also put on after we worked our way up 1 5mg risperidone every evening at dinner time to help his behavioral issues at night and to help him sleep which i must admit the risperidone did help him sleep however the ritalin even though it did help with the out of control hyperactivity also somehow caused him to space out in his preschool class put him in prek so he would have other children his age to play with and socialize with in hopes it would help so here it is he has had all of his toys taken away aside from books which i have him sit and read even if it is just making words up he is now getting up 5 7 times a night and has now resorted to sneaking food by the way he has been off all medication for over 2 months now so no its not the risperidone causing him to be hungry he has become even more verbally aggressive with the addition of phsyically aggrissive which is now causing issues in school he pushed a little boy in his class then took a toy from another and hit him with it and is becoming very physical with myself my husband and my daughter his almost 2 year old sister as well he knows he is to behave if he wants his toys back but continues to disobey and spits when he is asked to do something he now also cries aaallllll the time for nothing and everything he hits and kicks our 3 dogs and 3 cats yes he has even been nipped at once or twice which you would think would have had some impact but continues to do this anyway scares me more now that he has begun to do this with our 70lb 11 month old german sheppherd he knows about santa and has been told he will be put on the naughty list his response has been so i do not care you do not tell him what him what to do he will bring them anyway so no toys he gets sent to his room is made to do chores sits in a time out chair goes to bed early has any other priviledge taken away if it is needed and probably just about anything else you could think of i cannot do this anymore i am utterly exhausted and have been pushed beyond my breaking point broken and am almost to my shattering point i have researched every other possible alternative and tried them all for endless weeks all of them failing i am embarrassed to take him into public for the way he acts and feel like a failure as a mother that i cannot find a way to control my four year old son i am in desperate need of help please anybody',\n"," 'i ended my period like a the other day ago and i

in your system which can remain for weeks from stopthedrugwar org the ruling in arizona v shilgevorkyan overturned a decision by a superior court judge who said that it didnã t make sense to prosecute people for driving under the influence if theyã re not actually under the influence the appeals court disagreed citing its decisions on earlier challenges to the duid ã œthe legislature intended to create a ã per se prohibitionã and a ã flat banã on driving with any proscribed drug in oneã s system ã the court noted ã œwe determined that the legislative ban extends to all substances whether capable of causing impairment or not ã because the law was drafted to protect public safety the appeals court said it should be interpreted broadly to include inactive as well as active compounds opponents of the ruling argue that the law unfairly punishes medical marijuana users in the state especially if they arenã t driving under the influence it also discourages tourists especially from nearby states like colorado which has legalized marijuana and california which also has legal medical marijuana determining if a driver is driving while impaired from marijuana is a challenge for law enforcement there is currently no standard to determine how much thc is too much thc so cops basically guess they do rely on blood tests but even then safe levels of thc vary from person to person some police departments use a series of eye tests to determine if a driver is currently stoned hereã s a video ultimately as legal marijuana use becomes more and more prevalent it will probably be up

the length of unemployment has surged averaging about six months the report said this six month period surpasses the previous record average length of unemployment in the 1982 to 1983 recession which was about three months read about the stigma of unemploymentshrinking and disappearing paychecks have put strains on family finances one out of two adults surveyed said their finances are suffering more since the recession started the study said only 20 percent say they are in better financial shape since the recession began with less disposable income the recession has caused american families to rethink their spending habits the study finds about six out of ten americans reported tightening their spending habits about a third surveyed said they will continue being frugal with expenses even when the recession is over but a majority say they plan to revert to their pre recession spending habits and if american families are looking to find money in their homes they are likely to find bad

three to five years for the value of their home to recover from the recession but despite the shrinking value the vast majority of those polled say owning a home is the best long term investment the

three of the justices in the majority were republicans nevertheless a tea party group is now threatening to exact revenge upon the state supreme court for refusing to uphold a law that prevents many low income student and minority voters from casting a ballot a philadelphia area tea party group says it will work to defeat two state supreme court justices next year if the stateã s new voter

about 3yrs ago that was a very dark period in my life because i had been going through all kinds of moodswings and irritability i was in and out of hospitals and doctor offices only to be told that i had anxiety at first i thought i did because i was very stressed out but the way i was acting i knew that it was not my normal self i really wish that i could explain how hopeless and clueless and sad i felt life seemed really cold and dark to me i became deeply depressed it seemed like i had no one to turn to i remember one day i was sitting down at home on the computer and all of a sudden my heart started beating so fast i immediately called 911 because i thought that i was having a heart attack i did not know at the time that your heart stops beating if it a heart attack because i was clueless about what it was i was scared out of my mind anyway i was taken to the er and to make a long story short they was so interested in me taking drugs tests instead of trying to help calm my nerves and fears from what i remember my heart beats were about 160 as i now am aware that kinda high but i remember a nurse telling me that day that at my age i could handle it i remember pulling off those chest stickers and walked out if only i had known better i would have stayed and let them if they would have run some thorough tests to see what the problem was i would probably have saved myself more suffering and feel better today so to fast forward to today i eventually ended up receiving a rai 131 scan to confirm hyperthyroid the results said that after 24 hours i had an uptake of 83 which confirmed graves diseases i was put on methimazole which made me itch all over and become more irritated i then started taking benadryl which made me so tired my life was a mess i could not function for school or work i am telling you this disease had and still do me on some kind of bodily roller coaster the doctor that i have been seeing for this condition is not an endocrinologist and had little knowledge of this condition it unfortunate that i had no way to see an endocrinologist because my insurance do not cover specialty care however i am at the point that i am willing to go into debt because of my health right now i am really interested in a natural approach to stopping this dis ease i really hope someone has taken the time to read what i wrote up to this point but if not i will not stop trying to get to the bottom of what is causing my condition i know that it does not run in my family and so it had to be something wrong i did internally i have read that stress could trigger this condition and it makes me wonder if it the reason as i was robbed not even a year before my symptoms surfaced i have also had a root canal done which have been giving me problems since some info about what medications i taking now is methamizole 10mg about 4 times a day my tsh is 0 05 t4 is 8 5 t3 is 0 93 i try to limit meals with too much sodium and drink plenty of water oh and eat more fruits and veggies i really do not know what else to do besides this someone please give me some kind of advice about what to do or referrals to holistic natural doctors that have expertise with this condition please here are some of my lab results up to this point 9 24 2007 tsh 0 01 sadly my first primary care doctor never told me about an abnormal reading when i was tested

keep getting reacuring yeast infections each month i am unemployed and only have medicaid share of cost but cant afford the share of cost imagine that i have seen a couple doctors and they all tell me that they just find a little bit a yeast i am miserable and moody now because i just can not seem to figure out what the problem is it seems as if it all started after my second miscarrage miscarriage 4 months ago i am extremly itchy and uncomfortable it does not burn when i pee but after takeing monistat day 1 treatment it has been burning after i wipe after peeing i had no discharge until after useing monistat day 1 treatmnt i have read that many women have problems with monistat day one so i am not sure what to do now i think i made the problem worse it feels worse i can not afford another 20 30 over the counter treatments anymore i spend almost 50 a month on them i am sooo tired of feeling this way and very sexually frustrated doctors have mentioned laposcopy as the last options knowing that endometriosis runs in my family the problem is that i dont have a regular doc anymore so the others just do the same testing and want me to keep comeing back i can not afford any more doctors visits nor monistat so i was desperate and turned to home remedies which has worked somtimes before when i got a yeast infection i have tryed sea salt in bath water apple syder viniger in the bath water tons of garlic cloves tea tree oil and azo yeast pills nothing is working at all i took monistat 7 days ago and left my body alone for 4 days until my infection seemd to be getting worse is when i tryed home remidies i have also used my prescription topical cream the doc prescribed from the last yeast infection it help last time but not a all this time they have given me diflucin think its called 2 times last month but i am not sure if i works i am miserable and ran out of my options the only doc now that acepts medicaid can not see me for another month and my original doc no longer takes medicaid there had been no change in my diet eating the same as before all this not sure if i have been tested for diabetes before but i am sure i would know if i had diabeties i was just tested for std last month which was the clinic that prescribed me my topical cream and deflican negative hiv and negative everything except for hepitis a but he said thats good that i tested possitive for that but that it wasnt good that i tested negativ for another type of hepititis hepatitis b he suggested a vaccine saying that i could easliy catch it next time it comes around and that he sees that i had it before but must have been treated for it to my recognition i have never been told i had hepitits nor have been treated with shot like he explaind last month i had a normal period not very heavy

want to push u out the door just telling u anything and everything to put u at easy but nevr seem to get down to the problem i want a laposcopy done because i know there is something wrong and my mother has had endometriosis so i am thinking it is that i do not know how to request a laposcopy to my new doc i wil see in a month she will just want to do the same tests just to see for her self what the cause is but i am sooo tired of doing the same i want to get to the bottom of it im not sure if medicaid will cover laposcopy if i suggest it and if it is not needed in the docs eyes is there

to my jaw and below my jaw down my neck with swollen lymph nodes however surprisingly for me the repeated bite wing x rays did not reveal anything however i took amoxicillin and the symptoms quickly went away after 5 days the symptoms did not bother me except mildly on and off for several more months but last week as i was exercising and lifting weights i began to feel my heartbeat painfully in the tooth and the pain quickly onset again like before very severe pain in the same areas to my sinus pain when biting pain in jaw and neck with swollen lymph nodes as before the dentist who did the work dismissed any intervention due to the normal x rays and i was okay with that because the amoxil got rid of the symptoms the first time but this time it not working completely to help my symptoms

told me all the stuff i have read about that it unrealiable that you get too much etc i am suppose to be getting another thyroid test hopefully soon to see if it changed and then they are going to determine a course of action i told them that i went on a strict diet in 2005 that i started drinking soy milk and lots of soy related products my hair started looking dull in march of 06 i got sick in april with a fever and my hair started falling out like crazy once i started eating meat and protein again the hair stopped falling out 8 months later but has not full recovered i am convinced the soy milk is what caused the thyroid issue as no one in my family has these health issues i developed sweating issues and once off the soy milk this past september their nearly non existant i do not know if the continued sweating hardly bad is from the thyroid or if its from certain food that has soy in it it hard to avoid i try to eat organic and watch what i eat everyone in my family has a full head of my hair they checked my testosterone and since it normal they now think the hair loss is because of the thyroid can not these doctors make up their mind in the beginning he told me that his boss recommends armour but he does not now a couple months later he telling that his boss does not what is going on here is he that desperate to get me on a synthetic drug he wants me to think about levothyroxine i have also read that in some cases the subclinical kind can go away on it own i am thinking that being off the soy milk will definately help it but i have read that it can take 3 months to get the toxicity of the soy out of my system maybe even longer depending on how long i took it for i am so desperate to get things moving here i have been a bug on the wall for 3 years tired

president barack obama vowed monday to push vigorously for gun control measures and pressed foes of new restrictions in the aftermath of the newtown tragedy to examine their own conscience obama admitted he faced stiff opposition from gun rights advocates in congress and vowed executive action in the face of any legislative logjam one month to the day after the elementary school slaughter in connecticut the president said he had received recommendations from vice president joe biden task force for curbing a national epidemic of gun violence theyã ve presented me now with a list of sensible common sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw in newtown doesnã t happen again he told reporters ã œiã ll present the details later in the week ã but will congress adopt proposals like renewing the assault weapons ban ã œi donã t know ã acknowledged obama who was due to discuss the issue with biden later on monday ã œmy starting point is not to worry about the politics my starting point is to focus on what makes sense what works what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that weã re reducing the incidence of gun violence the president said ã œi think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the 2nd amendment ã obama also warned congressional republicans on monday that he will not trade spending cuts for their vote to raise the countryã s debt ceiling obama called republican talk of not raising the limitã of in effect not paying the countryã s billsã ã œirresponsibleã and ã œabsurd ã he said the gop will ã œnot collect a ransom in return for not crashing the economy ã œwe are not a deadbeat nation ã he said at issue is the congressionally established debt limit which the country is set to reach shortly without additional borrowing the government will not be able to pay all of its bills raising the prospect of a default on national debt payments or washington being forced to stop issuing social security checks pay to troops overseas and other legally required outlays according to obama either option would likely send shock waves through the fragile global economy raising the debt limit was mostly a matter of routine in washington under presidents of both parties for decades the opposition would make a big show of wringing its hands over the nationã s finances as a senator in 2006 obama himself called it ã œa sign of leadership failure and the majority would find a way to pass it republicans broke sharply from that script in august 2011 when they demanded spending cuts equal to the amount that the limit would be raised the ensuing standoff brought the nation to the brink of default and led to the first ever downgrade of the countryã s credit ratingã but also to historic spending cuts signed into law by obama top republican lawmakers have said publicly that this time they may be willing to partially shut down the government to secure more reductions ã œour economy is growing and our businesses are creating new jobs so we are poised for a good year if we make smart decisions and sound investmentsã and so long as washington politics ã œdonã t get in the way ã the president said',\n"," 'i have officially made it to my 9th week of pregnancy but still have to wait another 2 weeks to have my first ultrasound this is my second pregnancy after a

a fib it was in year 2000 i had been eating spicy food and red chillies raw with food i was put on comudain and since then i had about 3 4 episodes again every time either i had eaten heavy cheese and spices or simply spicy indian food my last episode still existing got triggered by a meal in a restraunt and the food was supposed to mild spicy and it came i think made of 100 red chillies only i ate about 6 spoons and it damaged my stomach lining and the a fib started i normally take metapronol to lower the heart rate and not move around so much and the first day is the hardest i sip milk eat plain yougurt eat only steamed vegetables rice and meals with only salt and no spices ice cream also helps to coat the stomach not sure if comudain has made the stomach lining more sensitve over 8 years use i have lvh left venrical hypertrophy with high bp which is controlled by lopressor rythmol afib comudain vasotec bp and lipitor does anyone know if lipitor also irritates the stomach i have been on it for 2 years and am thinking of dropping it my cholestrol is at border line my problem is not much excercise due busy life schedule to earn a living most of the time and then resting to gather the energy in my view the vagal nerve connected from stomach to heart is responsible for triggering afib when either too spicy food is eaten or extreme acid reflux gerd and triggered from a nerve from oesphugus when too much food is gulped down at a fast rate both nerves are connected to heart doctors openly will not admit to it and my cardioligist does not either we should write our experiances here so that the medical community does start to research this area and stop feeding comudian to us which was really discovered and made for rat poision to bleed the rats to death in wwii

sleeping it would feel like there were bricks on my chest well i switched back and told me doc i rather die than take amiodrone for me it worked i had to change my eating habits since i travel 10 months a year it is hard and some time you just end up eating something that is not right i usually stop and send the food back but you do not need much to damage the stomach specially if it is hot mexican food etc i will be going on boiled and steamed vegs and simple monk food and try to get off some of these meds would appreciate comments on lipitor',\n"," 'hi everyone i have never been to a

same urologist and he prescribed mupirocin ointment for a week no improvement i went back to my original doctor who said it may be fungal and so told me to try lotrimin or monestat i tried both with no improvement then i was given 2 doses of diflucan which also did not help at all i went and saw a dermatologist who told me it may be psoriasis and to try hydrocortisone ointment which has not helped either i also have switched to hypoallergenic detergent and soap and all cotton underwear i am beginning to seriously lose hope that anyone will be able to tell me what is wrong or how to fix

know i had a lot of tumour around my rectum and it usual to have at the least the ascending colon removed with appendix cancer i have also had all non essential abdominal organs and linings removed

therapeutic effect of very high dose vitamins lower doses commonly found in dietary supplements are effective in meeting nutritional needs but no therapeutic claims are made omns february 2 2009 there is a spin to most media reporting on vitamin research the recent anti vitamin media blitz led by the associated press and usa today provides yet another demonstration vitamins c and e do not prevent heart disease the associated press nov 9 2008 also usa today http www usatoday com news health 2008 11 09 supplements study_n htm with a paternalistic pat on the head the media once again seeks to send you off to play with the reassurance that well vitamin therapy has been tested and it just does not work nonsense thousands upon thousands of nutritional research studies provide evidence that vitamins do help prevent and treat serious diseases including cancer and heart disease when the nutrients are supplied in sufficiently high doses high doses are required low doses fail says cardiologist thomas levy m d the three most important considerations in effective vitamin c therapy are dose dose and dose if you do not take enough you wo not get the desired effects effective doses are high doses often hundreds of times more than the us recommended dietary allowance rda or daily reference intake dri abram hoffer m d ph d comments drs wilfrid shute and evan shute recommended doses from 400 iu to 8 000 iu of vitamin e daily the usual dose range was 800 to 1600 iu but they report that they had given 8 000 iu without seeing any toxicity the shutes successfully treated over 35 000 patients with vitamin e all the recent much touted jama study does is confirm what we already know low doses do not work the doses given were 400 iu of vitamin e every other day and 500 milligrams of vitamin c day try that same study with 2 000 to 4 000 iu of vitamin e every other day 1 000 to 2 000 iu day and 15 000 30 000 mg day of vitamin c and the difference would be unmistakable we know this because investigators using vitamins e and c in high doses have consistently reported success low doses do not get clinical results any physician nurse or parent knows that a dose of antibiotics that is one tenth or one hundredth of the known effective dose will not work indeed it is a cornerstone of medical science that dose affects outcome this premise is accepted with pharmaceutical drug therapy but not with vitamin therapy most of the best publicized vitamin e and c research has used inadequate low doses and this jama study falls right into line high doses of vitamins are deliberately not used writes robert f cathcart iii m d i have been consulted by many researchers who proposed bold studies of the effects of massive doses of ascorbate vitamin c every time the university center the ethics committee or the pharmacy committee deny permission for the use of massive doses of ascorbate and render the study almost useless seasoned researchers depending upon government grants do not even try to study adequate doses the most frequently proffered reason is the allegation that high doses of vitamins are not safe that is a myth 25 years of national poison control statistics show that there is not even one death per year from vitamins check the research literature and see for yourself exactly who is being harmed by vitamins aside from the pharmaceutical industry virtually nobody half of americans take vitamin supplements every day so where are the bodies decades of physicians reports and controlled research studies support the use of large doses of vitamins yet to hear the media and jama tell it vitamins are a granny folk remedy a buggy and barrel stave technology that just does not make it in the broadcast and print media vitamin therapy is marginalized at best and derided at worst is this merely laughable or is there method to it one may start by asking who does this serve could it possibly be the media huge advertising cash providers the pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical advertising money buys authors ad space influence and complicity unfortunately this is as true in the newspapers as it is in the medical journals

are the epidemic of hiv aids among prison inmates and a variety of sometimes violent events resulting in transmission of the disease some states long ago implemented policies to protect the uninfected part of the prison population while providing exceptional medical treatment and counseling to the infected population in south carolina it has worked so well since 1998 that there has only been a single transmission of hiv aids to a noninfected prisoner all that may change however thanks to a threat from eric holder justice department south carolina received a letter from the now infamous civil rights division that the policy of keeping infected inmates at a designated facility instead of scattered across the state in the general prison population may unfairly stigmatize infected prisoners to the obama political appointees in the civil rights division this constitutes discrimination under the americans with disabilities act the justice department objects to separate living facilities and specialized medical treatment for the hiv aids prison population naturally doj has threatened a lawsuit apparently the justice department does not have the will or resources to follow through in cases against new black panther party thugs brandishing weapons at polling places but has no difficulty shaking down a state with an effective and humane policy toward prisoners these folks are shameless says john ozmint the no nonsense director of the south carolina prison system referring to the civil rights division at doj he told me that every single new prisoner is tested for aids upon incarceration ozmint says half of those testing positive never knew they were infected the testing policy saves lives because treatment starts immediately at state expense those testing positive receive treatment at the broad river road correctional facility near columbia they also receive extensive counseling there but they are not part of the general prison population south carolina does not have to do this for starters the state does not have to test prisoners it could simply toss infected inmates unwittingly into the general prison population these inmates would be scattered across 28 facilities all without the specialized care available at the broad river facility all of the extra counseling and treatment is also optional but provided by the state at significant expense south carolina spends more than 2 million a year helping infected inmates in the very program the doj is challenging we could not ever hire specialists at all of the facilities spread across the state like we can in the single columbia facility ozmint told me the doj is in a lose lose situation even if doj wins a lawsuit sources tell me south carolina is simply going to cancel all of the special testing treatment and counseling thereby saving the state 2 million a year instead the state will dump infected prisoners into the general population and nobody will know they have aids worse prisoners who come to prison with hiv aids will never know they have the disease and their lives will be shortened because the testing program will end special counseling would end too of course if doj loses a lawsuit which seems likely they lose our policy promotes health and safety testing all inmates and treating hiv aids is expensive and many states do not test ozmint says they have identified which inmates can impose a death sentence by biting stabbing or merely inflicting a flesh wound with a contaminated weapon and we have eliminated the spread of hiv aids to other inmates or to staff justice raises three primary objections to this effective and humane approach first it prevents infected prisoners from participating in activities and jobs of their choosing leave it to bureaucrats in washington to concoct the grievance that prisoners have choices when it comes to activities in the first place second doj claims the south carolina program is unconstitutional something the courts have repeatedly rejected once again we see the rule of law falling by the wayside when it comes to decisions of this civil rights division this is the same civil rights division that was sanctioned more than 4 million during the clinton administration for bringing cases as frivolous as the one against south carolina prisons third with all the pragmatism of a sociology lecture at harvard doj argues that the separation of the hiv aids prisoners stigmatizes the prisoners ozmint responds prison is a voluntary activity breaking the law earning a criminal record and wearing tate issue all stigmatize since one purpose of prison is punishment this stigmatization is somewhat intentional how refreshing ozmint comments reveal the accelerating divide between highly paid bureaucrats in washington and people in the rest of the country having worked in the civil rights division i cannot emphasize strongly enough how perfectly correct and completely justified doj bureaucrats consider policies like the threat to south carolina to be and having lived and worked in the private sector and in parts of america far from the beltway i also cannot overstate just how insane such policies sound to most americans it is not just the south carolina prisons in the crosshairs of the civil rights division it is mortgage lenders and insurance companies it is movie theaters and flat broke counties that do not print ballots in foreign languages it also amazon com which tried to sell a talking kindle reader but justice said it could not because the button to make the kindle talk did not have braille never mind that books neither talk nor have braille buttons telling them to talk the business community would be wise to wake up and recognize the immense power the civil rights division exerts over the private sector groups like the u s chamber of commerce should devote resources to understanding and moderating the extremist tendencies of the current civil rights division even returning to clinton era policies would be an improvement keep in mind that the clinton justice department refused to attack the south carolina prison plan even though it was pressed to do so there is now a different species of democrat in power in washington even south carolina democrats have disclaimed their party brethren in washington over the doj threat this is the last thing incumbent democrat john spratt needs in his contest against mick mulvaney in the rural 5th congressional district more proof the administration in washington has gone bonkers this is about whether you want more aids or less aids in the prisons ozmint said all indications are that the south carolina department of corrections is not going to surrender an inch to the doj officials promise to do whatever it takes to defeat a lawsuit no case brought by the civil rights division is bulletproof many defendants incorrectly think they can never defeat the department in litigation so they capitulate and settle

got pg again i nkow that is very rare but omg the thought terrifies me lol from what i understand is you have to keep going back to the urologist with a sample so they can check if there are any sperm left and it is not considered safe until the sample is cleared i told dh that and he did not seem to have any problem with it and was still on board even agreed it should be done soon this was months ago since i obviously can not get pg while pg and for the weeks after the birth when we have to abstain well the baby is due any day now and still no appointment and he has not brought up the subject

problem with this because he had to go to summer school last year and get phone calls from teachers almost every day because he cusses them and wont leave other students alone and disrupts almost every class well my wake up call was in nov of 08 one of his teachers calls to tell me that he was sitting on another students desk and after several times of telling him to get off of the desk he got up and the top of the desk broke a screw popped out and hit the teacher in the eye well we take him to the dr and he sends me to a psychiatrist they ran some tests on him at the hospital and turned out he does have adhd the dr prescribed hi m abilify 2 5mgs daily also melatonin at night for good rest the 1st night on the melatonin he wet the bed i called the doc back that day and she told me to take him off of the melatonin still bedwetting occasionally on april 1 2009 he got very angry because he had to go to the dr again and refused to get into my car when i picked him up at his dad s he asked his grandpa step where the key to his dad s gun cabinet is that he wanted to shoot me or worse himself i called the police because i can not control him and neither could his step grandpa the police made him get in my car and go to the dr and told us to make sure that all the guns are removed from the dad s home the pediatrician took him off of the abilify and sent us back to therapy well

work he told me several times he hates me and wishes i would die he s also telling his little brother to tell me the same thing i took him to a new psychiatrist yesterday and he says he thinks that he does not have adhd so i am very confused it is not normal to tell your own mother you hate her let alone tell her to die this has been going on for a year now cursing me all the time staying out all the time as late as he wants i feel like i am a failure as a mother and that it is my fault but i know this is another wake up call for me and i don t what to do and feel like there is nowhere else to

the past year or so i have noticed that my urine gets very cloudy i have no pain no other symptoms of liver failure however cloudy urine is a symptom of liver failure so i assume my liver situation is worsening the cloudiness used to take a couple hours to be evident now it takes but an hour while i have not returned for any additional tests i believe i am in liver failure i will make an effort to post to the list how i progress with this if there is interest i do not plan to change anything in my lifestyle i am not a transplant kind of guy so do not expect to heal if the list members are

my parents my son is 4 and started school this year in pre k i was hoping that interacting with others would calm him down and open him up but i was wrong his history he was born at 41 weeks had no problems except for the webing under his tongue need to be cut so he could feed properly he was colic bad up until 4 months after that he developed cronic chronic constipation which went undiegnosed till age 2 where he was tested xrayed seen a specialist and had more things done to him a grown man would run from he is an extreamly picky eater which makes it very hard to make him eat regular food he is literally 28 lbs at 4 yrs old and was 20 lbs for 2 years his sister is 5 10 1 2 months apart and they have the usual fights like all siblings do okay more for mental issues his father and me are not together due to fights at 2 years old i remember his father screaming at him one day because he came home very stressed and i was busy with cooking so i couldnt really tend to the kids they were fussy and crying wonderful military for you soon after i left my husband because of abuse once my kids and i moved i noticed he was having nightmares and crying in his sleep it took awhile for him to get over those he started to act out at 3 yrs old screaming crying throwing himself on the ground hitting his head on things hitting himself and just being dificult he started being agressive to his sister who is terrified of him when he gets angry he will throw toys at her hit kick and even bite her at school i get the same talk he hits other kids and hits his teacher screams throws his food and will not calm down he has these fits several times in a 5 hour period i have tried talks with him being calm time out taking away toys and it just doesnt work he is so short tempered anything will set him off even positive praise when he is good very quiet shy loving i think all this might be tied to the over whelming pain he delt with due to his dad doing what he did and us fighting when he was younger him being colic and then the cronic chronic constipation he wont go 2 for a week to 2 wks all in a very short time period can agression be passed down geneticly his father is very agressive and dificult as well ive noticed even his family has issues like that im truely lost ive asked the doctor about what can be done and she is clueless ive asked the school and they are pointless and push us aside love the public school for that i find myself crying almost every morning because of this im scared im gonna have the next kid who is thrown in jail for his temper or be thrown out of

me on augmentin 875g bid and said my xray showed an abcess abscess above the bad tooth by the way i never had any pain whatsoever at all 1 week later i returned to his office for a debridement of the abcess abscess he said the antibiotics were doing the job and no pus came out at all he put a temp filling over the tooth and i will return in one month for a root canal and crown however today 2 days

situation relatively well aside from issues with sleeping been with me for 2 months and she had been living with dad and sister for a year sees mom every other weekend she has positive reinforcement from both of us she does very well in her new school and her personality has begun to shine there have not been any major behavioral issues she is provided with honest answers as to the situation with her mom and dad and sister has changed i work for a pre school program and practice parenting skills encouraging free spirit and creativity while maintaining respect for herself the people and things around her i am not too strict but have much more structure and routine in the house than she is used to with all that said she has maintained a balanced transition however the past couple of weeks she has been waking in the middle of the night often times crying and carrying on her daddy works every other night so some nights its just me and others both of us are in the house so that is not an issue i think she claims several different reasons for being awoken sometimes its thinking that someone is going to get into the apartment sometimes its a spider on the wall sometimes its thinking she hears people talking we can calm her down sometimes but then she usually will come back to wake us or start crying again within 20 30 minutes sometimes less we ask how we can help and she always wants to go into the living room and watch tv most of the time this helps but other times she will continue to cry and scream for me her daddy and sometimes her mommy i am not positive this is an issue of night terrors or if this is behavioral and bordering on temper tantrum we begrudgingly tried a tv in her bedroom but that was not good enough did not have the right channels which sent her crying for 45 minutes she has spent upwards of 3 hours crying and screaming in her bedroom at 3am before to the point that i intervined so that she wouldnt make herself sick tried comforting singing reading new

several months now on a black spot in my vision i read the other posts to see if anything was mentioned about it but i mean its like u said floaters but here is the trick it does not float around its in one spot all the time unless i move my eye ball to the side but it moves with the eye if i look left its not that noticable but i look right its noticable and same when i look straight i also at times get these ash lookin is the best way to describe it spots but it also flickers and seems like ash is really falling in front of me what i mean by flicker not like a light switch but like a light bulbs electric wire that makes light bright then fades on occasions and that only my left eye my right i have a twitch that i can not say how offten or if there is a pattern because it occures off and on for example it will twitch one day out of the blue the twitching lasts for about a minute then stops and it happens again and lasts a lil over a minute then stops i tryed to just rub it away maybe its my nerves tightning up but when an eposode happens it tends to drag out for an hour off and on like i said but that not my main concern i am more worried about my left eye but would like some advise on whats going on with both of them i been to eye doctors as a child nothing was detected but i was told to wear glasses when i did not even need them i have twenty twenty vision so i know what ever is wrong has not affected my vision but i was at age 19 told to were glasses again due to my studies that required being in front of a computer screen for 8 hours a day if not more and i am talkin without no breaks my vision ended up in both eyes becoming blurry like water in my eyes but i had no tears nor water in my eyes they were normal i also have these bad headaches that are i would have to say by my eyes i discribed the feeling and where it was coming from to family and a family doctor they said it a migraine yet i did not have sensitivity to light nor noise just the pain that was coming from the back of my eyes to the front and even the sides like if it could just be a tension headache i tried over the counter migrain medicine advil ibrophin tylonal asprin alieve a frozen eye mask even nothin seems to work for the pain so i just deal with it i have never been given an mri on my brain but been told to get one done but i do not know if that would even help either or am i wrong i have had my head banged up on pavment concrete large objects such as hard cover thick thick books bats basically hard objects to the head as i was young and sometimes i get pushed hard where i hit my head on a cabinate door and i have blacked out a couple of times when hit or hit my head i have never been taken to the hospital though to get checked due to me being affraid of doctors and also that trust that i do not have with them i honestly do not see a doctor unless i have to for a female the yearly check up and to get antibiotics if i have an infection but so you are aware my last visit everything is normal blood and urine came out fine no diabetes no high cholesterol nothing not even high blood pressure the only thing wrong with me is my weight but my health is as if an active healthy weight person if not better just a weight issue so i am confussed i mean in my family eye problems are a thing but like i said all the eye doctors i have seen said i have perfect vision and there is no need for glasses nor do i have anything wrong with my eyes i have had a wire hanger jammed into my right eye and that when i started the twitchin in that eye so i can see that as a reason why my eye twitches and no i did not seek medical attention when i got help to remove the hanger and that happened oh i would have to say when i was about 10 1 2 11 years old i am currently 23 years old by the way back to the headaches i know it has to deal with my eyes since the pain is only coming from my eyes and no where else at times my eye sockets hurt so much that it even hurts to blink my eyes get blood shocked and when they are really bad i end up with nose bleeds or even wake up with my pillow covered in blood i am totally concerned and i do not know what to do first when i mention my headaches to my primary physician i get a feeling as if he not listining so i just gave up and like i said i been dealing with the pain also the aggitation of the black spot and ash at times in the left eye and twitching in the right but like the twitchin has been like that for18 or 18 1 2 years so i am kind of used to it by now it just the ash thing and blsck spot but i would like to get you opinion and maybe some advise on what i should do first headaches are an everyday thing just other days are worse then others i can not tollerate it any more i do not want to have to go my whole life with headaches and wierd eye things going on so i come to you for your professional oppinion and well some guidance on what i need to do and if its something major or just something mild and can be taken cared of please help i do not know what else to do and i feel as if i am not taking the right way about all of this so i would like your help if you can please even if you have no clue on whats

severe he told us that you never do heart surgery to early because of the risks and you have to watch to make sure you do not do it late either they wanted her to do a stress echo which she just did that was what his findings were that he feels it is just moderate and not time to do the surgery when she had the stress echo done the dr told her that when she started she had all these extra beats that were all over the place and she should have that looked into i need to give you some past on my daughter she went into cardiac arrest 4 years ago they feel it seemed like because her potassium

get intervention and be caught up her teacher called me at home from her home after only the fifth full day of school and wanted to discuss some things with me the first thing is that my daughter had her shoe off for whatever reason and took her shoe to the teacher and just held it to her b c she needed help putting it back on but she would not ask i should add my child is very shy and reserved especially in a public setting the teacher told me she asked my child what she needed a few times and she would not answer so she took her out in the hall and sat her down and and told her if she wanted her shoe back on she would have to ask so my child screamed put my shoe on and was upset the next thing is that she asked them all there are 26 kids in this class to take out the blue crayon and my daughter took out pink she knows her colors and refused to get blue out so the teacher took the pink crayon away from her and this upset my daughter she also told me my child has a hard time

suggested i add more fiber to my diet i am a vegetarian so i tend to eat a lot already get a source of psyllium which i can get through eating kelloggs all bran buds in the morning and cutting out beans and lentils which may be giving me some gassy problems and making my pain worse the thing is that i do not really think that fiber is my problem although my digestive system seems to be working

atmosphere research satellite is definitely making its final fiery plunge to earth on friday for two weeks experts on orbital debris has been telling people that the 20 year old bus sized spacecraft would soon fall through the atmosphere and drop about two dozen pieces of debris on earth ã but until this morning there was too much uncertainty to say exactly which day that would happen in today update nasa says it will be sept 23 u s time the time reference does not mean that the satellite is expected to re enter over the united states the update said it is simply a time reference although it is still too early to predict the time and location of re entry predictions of the time period are becoming more refined the six ton satellite orbit is limited to between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south spanning the width of the world between northern canada and the tip of south america in the past nicholas johnson the head of nasa orbital debris program office has estimated that the chances that any of the uars debris would hit anybody were 1 in 3 200 ã which translates into a 1 in 20 trillion risk for any particular person you for example unless you are living in say finland in that case there zero risk now that the time frame for the fall has been refined you could theoretically tweak those odds as well as the likely fall zone to match the satellite orbital track for friday but nasa johnson wo not take on that exercise at that point we do not compute odds he told me today the satellite will simply fall where it falls from here on in nasa and its partners at the u s strategic command will be issuing updates on the timing at 24 hours before the expected fall t minus 12 hours t minus 6 hours and t minus 2 hours ã and we will be passing those predictions along but even two hours before re entry experts wo not be able to project exactly where the debris will end up when uars predicament first came to light a couple of weeks ago johnson said the margin of error for the 500 mile 800 kilometer fall zone would be somewhere around 6 000 miles or a quarter of the way around the planet the uncertainty arises because of a couple of factors solar outbursts like the ones we have been getting over the past few weeks lead to a faster decay of orbits for low flying spacecraft also the satellite is tumbling which leads to unpredictable atmospheric drag effects because there no fuel left for orbital maneuvering no one has any control over uars orbital course most of the satellite will burn up in the atmosphere but nasa estimates that about a half ton worth of fragments will survive re entry and fall to earth the computer models suggest that the biggest chunk would weigh about 300 pounds 150 kilograms or as much as a refrigerator anyone who happened to be in the vicinity of the debris fall would see bright streaks in the sky much like the fireworks seen when pieces of russia mir space station fell to earth in 2001 the most likely outcome is that the remnants of the uars satellite would fall into a desolate patch of ocean or an uninhabited stretch of land far away from any witnesses or potential victims throughout the entire 54 years of the space age there has been no confirmed report of anybody in the world being injured or severely impacted by any re entering debris johnson noted two weeks ago',\n"," 'i have had kidney soreness for a month i

the federation for american immigration websitealthough the united statesã welfare rolls are already swollen every year we import more people who wind up on public assistance immigrants many immigrants are poor indeed that is why they come here the immigrants we admit are much poorer than the native population and are increasing the size of our impoverished population as a result the share of immigrant households below the poverty line 18 percent is much higher than the share of native households that are poor 11 percent ã nearly twice as high and immigrant households are more likely to participate in practically every one of the major means tested programs immigrant use of welfare programs 21 percent is 43 percent higher than non immigrantsã use 15 percent 1each year state governments spend an estimated 11 billion to 22 billion to provide welfare to immigrants 2why are immigrants on welfare some people mistakenly think that immigrants are not eligible for welfare several years ago congress did attempt to render immigrants ineligible for most forms of welfare however subsequent backpedaling by congress and the executive branch has undone most of those reforms furthermore many immigrant families get welfare through the eligibility of their u s citizen children it is also important to realize that even when immigrants are ineligible for federal welfare programs the burden of their support is simply shifted over to the state and local welfare agencies refugees asylees and all amnestied illegal aliens are exempt from the public charge requirement 3 congress has decided that the american people will serve as the sponsors for these immigrants and pick up the tab for their support all other immigrants must pass a public charge test and have a u s sponsor or sponsors willing to pledge their income to support them before a potential immigrant receives an immigration visa american consular officers are supposed to evaluate whether he or she is likely to become a public charge and if so to deny the visa the consular officer is supposed to take into account a variety of factors the amount of support the sponsor can give the resources and skills of the applicant and any special conditions such as age or infirmity that might affect the applicantã s need for support the immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 set the new legal standard for the evaluation the sponsor of the applicant must have an annual income of at least 125 percent of the federally designated poverty level there are several problems with this standard the sponsorship income level only 25 percent higher than the poverty level is so low that it does not prevent immigrants from going on welfare in fact it almost guarantees it say a sponsor begins with an income of 200 percent of poverty level and is therefore not considered ã œlegally poor ã but after splitting that income with the immigrant each will be at 100 percent of the poverty level where before we had one non poor person now we have two poor people since eligibility for some welfare programs kicks in before oneã s income drops to 125 percent of poverty level immigrants can easily wind up on welfare while immigrants who receive welfare can be deported for violating the conditions under which they were admitted this provision is rarely enforced in fact only twelve people have been deported under this provision since 1980 4 administrative rulings have held that an immigrant cannot be held responsible for receiving welfare unless the welfare agencies have sent the immigrant a bill for their services demanded payment and been refused payment 5 since welfare agencies do not do this it is virtually impossible for an immigrant to be charged with violating the public charge provisions that can lead to deportation furthermore numerous forms of welfare are not considered under the public charge test including food stamps pre natal care nutrition programs housing assistance energy assistance job training programs child care services free or reduced school lunch public shelters health clinics medicaid and any cash welfare programs that are not the familyã s sole source of income 6 this insulates immigrants from being considered public charges unless they are completely dependent on welfare what types of welfare are immigrants eligible for as of the 1996 welfare reform bill the following applies to eligibility for federal and state funded welfare programs legal immigrants are barred from all federal means tested public benefits for five years after entering the country and barred from ssi and food stamps until citizenship they are also barred from all federal means tested public benefits for five years 7 benefits available to immigrants include school lunch and breakfast programs immunizations emergency medical services disaster relief and others programs that are necessary to protect life and safety as identified by the attorney general regardless of immigration status 8 illegal immigrants are barred from the following federal public benefits grants contracts loans licenses retirement welfare health disability public or assisted housing post secondary education food assistance and unemployment benefits states are barred from providing state or locally funded benefits to illegal immigrants unless a state law is enacted granting such authority 9welfare reform failed to solve the problemdespite expectations that the 1996 welfare reform bill would cause significant changes in immigrant welfare use it has actually remained at the same level the 1996 welfare reforms failed because while the legislation cut immigrants off from certain welfare programs the savings that resulted from those cuts were not high enough to offset the increased usage of the remaining programs due to the continuing high number of immigrants entering the u s every year while both temporary aid to needy families tanf and food stamp use have declined by four percent the decline did not result in any significant savings as those costs were offset by increases in medicaid use which has increased among immigrant households the total combined value of benefits and payments received by immigrant households from welfare programs remained almost the same averaging almost 2 000 in 2001 about 50 percent higher than natives such high rates of immigrant welfare use combined with the rapidly increasing immigrant population has resulted in a four percent increase in the number of immigrant households on welfare from 14 percent in 1996 to 18 percent in 2000 10outlook for the futurethe highest welfare use rates for immigrants are in new york 30 percent california 28 percent massachusetts 25 percent and texas 25 percent 12immigrants are eleven percent of our population but they are 20 percent of the poor population unless our immigration policies are reevaluated and changed accordingly welfare usage and subsequent costs will remain high instead of addressing the problem some in congress have suggested measures that would make it even worse such as proposals to increase immigrantsã eligibility for benefits the congressional budget office estimates that making legal immigrants eligible for medicaid and the state childrenã s health insurance program schip would cost an estimated 2 24 billion over ten years 11if we are to have any hope of reducing poverty in the u s our immigration laws must be revised and returned to the sensible practice of excluding aliens who are likely to become public charges and to deport those who do',\n"," 'my grandson is 5 and he always seems to be doing things that will get him in trouble when asked why he does these things he says i do not know it my brain it evil then

to 75 000 each in mid may both mitt romney and his wife each contributed 75 000 to the victory fund there is also an obama victory fund which allows large donors to cut equally big checks but when team obama announced raising 43 6 in april the fec filings later showed that the campaign raised 25 7 million the dnc raised 14 3 million although nearly half of that dnc money came from a transfer from the obama victory fund when team obama collects large checks the first 5 000 go to the campaign which is the individual maximum 30 800 go to the dnc which is the max and the rest go to the other

door mail delivery will go away the u s postal service is marching towards a more centralized delivery where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood local postmasters are sending hundreds of letters to fast growing communities warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments in the past year the cash strapped postal service has been asking companies in industrial parks and shopping malls to also adopt this form of mail delivery but rep darrell issa the california republican leading the house effort to save the postal service wants more he has made doing away with doorstep delivery a key part of his bill which would require everyone to get mail at a curbside box or from a cluster box a balanced approach to saving the postal service means allowing usps to adapt to america changing use of mail said issa who is chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee moving away from door to door delivery saves a lot of money right now 35 million residences and businesses get mail delivered to their doorstep it costs 353 per stop for a delivery in most american cities taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport by contrast curbside mail box delivery costs 224 while cluster boxes cost 160 according to a report from the postal service office of inspector general delivering mail is the agency largest fixed cost 30 billion ending such door deliveries would save 4 5 billion a year that more than the 3 billion it would have saved from ending saturday mail service according to government reports related los angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bitesthat why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the greeting card association which supports saturday service but unions say it a bad idea to end delivery to doorsteps and will be disruptive for the elderly and disabled it madness said jim sauber chief of staff for the national association of letter carriers the idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in buffalo new york in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy yet postal officials say everything on the table when it comes to cost cutting earlier this year it tried to end saturday mail delivery but later reversed its decision usps fails to deliver 5 5 billionusps fails to deliver 5 5 billionthe postal service continues to struggle with mail volume especially drops in first class mail its big revenue driver as more americans move to electronic billing and e mailing in 2012 the agency lost 16 billion last year the agency twice defaulted on payments owed to the federal government to prefund retiree health care benefits totaling 11 billion the agency has also exhausted a 15 billion line of credit from the u s treasury ending a congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retiree health care benefits would help solve the agency woes as it awaits for help from congress the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own one of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments prior to this spring we would work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curbline delivery now the postal service makes that decision said postal service spokeswoman sue brennan related wave of federal retirees to hit governmentin cranberry pa the community is up in arms after getting a letter in april from the postal service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety access and maintenance township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes we understand what is driving this is a cost savings said cranberry township manager jerry andree but you can not just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety use and access for now residents already receiving door delivery will see no change unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a mailman or congress changes the law said steven hutkins a professor of literature at new york university and a postal service expert the big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery

by president woodrow wilson on october 3 1913 to mark the occasion moyers company caught up with david cay johnston who has probably forgotten more about our tax code than most economic experts ever knew johnston won a pulitzer prize in 2001 for his comprehensive reporting on taxes and tax avoidance in the new york times and then authored a best selling book on the subject perfectly legal the covert campaign to rig our tax system to benefit the super rich ã and cheat everybody else below is a lightly edited transcript of our discussion joshua holland when we got into world war ii individuals and families paid 38 percent of federal income taxes and corporations picked up the other 62 percent last year individuals and families paid 82 percent of federal income taxes and corporations paid just 18 percent how did this happen david cay johnston all modern societies require a large public sector to provide the goods and services on which the private sector depends so you need commonwealth services ã education basic research statistical gathering and civil law enforcement ã a whole host of activity than can only be provided through the public sector now corporations have a concentrated interest in the taxes they pay and the capacity to lobby for changes and make campaign donations to rent or in some cases buy politiciansã votes over a long period of time they saw to it that we change these tax laws and shifted this burden we also dramatically increased the size of the federal government during the period from before world war ii until now and some of the additional money youã re seeing is the result of increased social security taxes and medicare taxes ã some programs that benefit people generally and that i think we should look at as efficient buying at the wholesale level rather than retail holland unpack that for me david johnston sure corporations in the days before world war ii were essentially domestic operations with a few exceptions and we now have a global economy and in the global economy corporations all around the world are going to push to get the lowest tax ã or no tax at all in some places ã and then use that to pressure the us government to ease their tax burdens theyã ve also by the way put in place innumerable little rules changes involving accounting and depreciation ã that is writing down the value of equipment as itã s being used up ã and other things to reduce their bills holland and does this help explain why we have a very low tax burden overall relative to other wealthy countries but a lot of americans feel that theyã re being taxed to death johnston well one of the reasons some americans feel theyã re being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes which are low compared to other modern countries and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries ã a lot of our health care costs higher education costs admissions and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things ã lo and behold we end up being a relatively high tax country but it depends on how you analyze the data and let me give you one killer figure we spend so much money on our health care in this country ã or as i prefer to think of it sick care in this country ã that for every dollar that the other 33 modern economies spend for universal coverage we spend 2 64 and this is done using something called ã œpurchasing parity dollars ã so theyã re truly comparable so we spend 2 64 per person and still have almost 50 million people with no coverage and 30 million with limited coverage and these other countries spend far less with universal coverage hereã s how much that costs in the year 2010 if we had had the french health care system which is one of the most expensive in the world it would have provided universal coverage and it also would have saved us so much money that we could have eliminated the individual income tax that year and all else would have been equal our excess health care costs above those of the french were a little over 6 percent of the economy and the income tax in 2010 brought in about 6 percent of the economy http www rawstory com rs 2013 10 04

dispense with the insane yet oft repeated argument during the obamacare debate that passing the bill was the surest way to mitigate losses in the midterms there were two political reasons to pass o care as youã ll recall 1 long term passage will set the country irreversibly on the path to socialized medicine which in turn will create a culture of dependency guaranteeing big democratic victories far into the future 2 short term passage will cheer liberals and inspire them to turn out in november whereas letting the bill drop will break liberal hearts all over again a la 1993 and will ensure a republican rout in the midterms can we now agree with the gop reaching historic leads on the generic ballot that the second reason has turned out to be a little well insane or is the new argument that

she has the slightest heart murmer but the degree of her murmer is so minor there no way it would cause her to suddenly go unconscious now something else has happend she was her normal self and sudenly spaced out completey she was staring into space looking towards the ground with her eyes moving back and forth slightly like reading a book she was not responding to any stimulation snapping fingers in front of her nose calling her name lifting and dropping her arm at her side but she finally snapped out of it about 20 seconds later when her favorite toy was shaken twice we have now visited a neurologist who did initial tests and said she completely normal from what he sees we are scheduled to do an eeg in a month but he thinks he wo not find anything he thinks it a circulatory

stop putting her throught all these tests so my question is if a pediatric cardiologist says her heart is practically perfect could she still have a circulatory issue i mean if her heart is pumping as

surprise that how some pundits describe mia love a republican congressional nominee in utah who is upending stereotypes about the state and its predominant faith a rising star and mayor of a small utah city she will have a brief prime time speaking role on tuesday at the republican convention love 36 is a black mormon in a deeply conservative state where her race makes up less than 3 percent of the population if she bests the popular right of center democratic incumbent jim matheson in november love would be the first black conservative woman elected to the u s house of representatives although polls show she faces an uphill battle i believe our country is in big trouble said love also a runner who teaches fitness classes if i can make a difference not only should i do it it my obligation as a parent and an american in 2010 she was the first black woman elected as mayor of a utah city she also a first generation u s citizen whose parents immigrated to new york from haiti in the 1970s in search of the american dream and who wanted to make sure their daughter contributed to society love a mother of three says she running against six term incumbent matheson in the newly created 4th district in central utah to do just that matheson represents utah 2nd district and opted to run in the 4th after redistricting scattered his constituents that love captured the republican nomination was a surprise both in and out of utah a tea party darling she is now seen as representing the strongest chance in a decade for republicans to push matheson the lone democrat in utah congressional delegation and a fellow mormon out of office a wild card little known outside of saratoga springs a farming hamlet turned city of 18 000 about 35 miles south of salt lake city love leap frogged over a crowded field including two better known state lawmakers to snag the nomination with over 70 percent of the vote at the state republican convention in april utah political insiders chalked up her victory to a confluence of events including infighting between two front runners and an engaging speech by love that hit all the right notes for the traditionally conservative delegates she champions limited government fiscal discipline personal responsibility and state rights she pro gun and holds a concealed weapon permit opposes abortion and has said she would favor dismantling the federal departments of energy and education she also supports utah effort to reclaim public lands from federal agency controls and would vote against regulations she believes would restrict economic development she was clearly a wild card matthew burbank a university of utah political science professor said she not all that different in the sense of her political views and her being a member of the majority religion on the other hand she does have a life story that is different than anybody i can think of in utah politics love has the backing of the national republican congressional committee which has given her campaign nearly 1 million for fall television ads i have never had a problem with people calling me a shiny new toy but hopefully it what i stand for that matters love said i was elected as mayor with 60 percent of the vote and it was not because i am black and i am female republican senator john mccain of arizona and house speaker john boehner have campaigned for love in utah former secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to appear at a utah event on september 7 ann romney wife of republican presidential contender mitt romney has endorsed love as has romney running mate paul ryan but national support or even her speaking role at the republican convention may not help love gain enough ground to win a recent poll conducted for salt lake city media outlets the deseret news and ksl television found she trailed the race 53 percent to 38 percent focus on racestill there no question that love race is part of what is drawing the attention of party leaders said lavar webb a longtime salt lake city based republican strategist they would not discuss this publicly but the fact that a black woman could be elected in utah i think would signal that the state is more diverse and open minded and cosmopolitan than people believe webb said matheson the son of utah last democratic governor has held his seat because he viewed as a moderate who breaks party lines to vote with republicans on issues that align with utah more conservative values pundits said matheson however disagreed that love offers voters anything dramatically different from past challengers i do not think most utahns want to get rid of the department of energy or the department of education matheson said earlier this year at a community event it just sounds like

new claims for us unemployment benefits jumped more than expected last week official data showed thursday on the eve of the key june jobs report initial claims for jobless benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 472 000 in the week ending june 26 an increase of 13 000 from the previous week upwardly revised level of 459 000 the labor department said the leap was sharply higher than the consensus analyst forecast of 458 000 claims the four week moving average which helps smooth out weekly volatility rose 0 7 percent to 466 500 the trend has generally been moving higher in recent weeks suggesting that the labor market is perhaps starting to weaken said andrew gledhill at moody economy com in the previous week ending june 19 the insured unemployment rate was 3 6 percent unchanged from the prior week revised rate the department said the number of people collecting unemployment insurance benefits in the week to june 19 rose by 43 000 to 4 616 000 while the four week moving average slipped 0 5 percent to 4 567 500 gledhill called recent moves in claims troubling in typical job market recoveries claims would be much lower below 400 000 but in the current situation they have remained stubbornly elevated part of the explanation is that hiring is very low potentially prompting a greater share of unemployed than is typical to file for benefits coming out of a recession the weekly jobless claims data came on the eve of the department key june jobs report widely expected to show worsening conditions most analysts expect the data friday will show the unemployment rate rose to 9 8 percent from 9 7 percent in may and the economy shed 100 000 nonfarm jobs after adding 431 000 in the prior month mainly temporary government jobs for the 2010

periods of time i have had a multitude of procedures over the past few years and have become accustomed to and adjusting to low vision in any case i have had more retinaplexi for horshoe tears in the retina 3 this year and the specialist explained that the vitreaous is pulling away and occasionally causes these tears i think the doc is getting a bit more concerned lately although he tells us its ok because he has me on a 2 3 month exam schedule now went from yearly to 9 to 6 and now every 2 3 months my question is this lately my reading vision is worse not a lot but noticeably worse my distance vision seems to be the same i thinjk the doc told us one time that the macula had some bouts with macular swelling and a pucker peel vitrectomy in the right eye effects close up or detail vision but we think he said the vetreous pulling away also effects close up vision in older patients i am only 54 but the doc told us one time that my eyes remind him of much older in terms of condtions before my macular pucker and vitrectomy rt eye that eye was of no help to read ect and was makeing me sick from all the wavey images and the procedure has taken care of that 100 and i can almost read the top line of the reading chart with it now does the vitreous pulling away effect reading vision i am constantly getting round dot floaters in my left eye and doc said eventually we may have to do a vitrectomy on the left eye but does not want to until absolutely needed i asked if it was because of possible side effects and he said no he just feeles it would be better to wait i do have lens issues occular rosacea dry eye chronic conjuntivitis all that flare up and lower reading i know it can come from them but i am treating all those and they have their ups and downs it just seems like the baseline reading vision is consistantly a bit worse and we are trying to decide about calling doc or waiting until june 4 appointment if no further or increased problems it pretty much sounded to my wife and i that my reading vision would always be a struggle and the low vision aids are about all i can do right now i have so many small issues that it becomes a bigger issue overall is how one doc explained it does a vitrectomy slow down or stop vitreous pulling away why would they want to wait if it does not cause side effects my rt eye is not real helpful to read but since the peel vitrectomy i have had no round dots and havent noticed any floaters since 1 1 2 years thanksi realize there are so many issues here purhaps if nothing else you could refresh us on why my reading

about every topic under the sun then he takes off in the car and threatens to look for a place to live last night i asked him why we have become so isolated from our friends and why our relationship is turning into roommates and not romantic partners he shifts the blame on me telling me i have not lost the baby fat after my pregnancy 2 years ago i am 115 pound 5 6 and my friends the ones i still

negative i took the dosage as prescribed but the tingling sensation around my penis continued to exist though scabies went away on 7th march 10 i got tested for gonorrhea chlamydia through a swab test

and 32 221 were wounded in battle leaving behind a deeply divided country steeped in corruption and despite a 60 billion u s effort to rebuild iraq life for most iraqis has not improved significantly according to a bitter and regretful retrospective by iraqi officials and u s diplomats military officers and politicians their views come with the final report of the special u s inspector general for iraq reconstruction released wednesday congress set up the sigir office in november of 2003 to monitor the vast sums of iraqi and u s money being spent by the u s occupation authorities in baghdad over nine years inspector general stuart w bowen and his staff relentlessly tracked down what happened to the 146 billion in iraqi money and the 60 billion in u s funds much of it airlifted to iraq in pallets of shrink wrapped 50 bills despite the claims of president george w bush and other u s officials that the united states would rebuild an even better iraq after the march 2003 invasion and occupation the money underperformed bowen noted dryly in the report there was misspending of money said iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki in one of the colossal understatements contained in the massive report the one bright spot the report said was the 20 2 billion the united states spent to train and equip iraqi security forces which have managed to keep iraq relatively stable despite rising political tensions and sectarian violence but apart from the detailed investigations and assessments in the final sigir report it is the observations of senior iraqi and american officials that are most damning bowen and his staff talked with maliki and iraqi politicians and jurists former ambassador ryan crocker former gen david petraeus and gen ray odierno now u s army chief of staff bush former vice president cheney former defense secretary donald rumsfeld and l paul bremer who ran iraq in the crucial years of 2003 and 2004 as head of the coalition provisional authority cpa did not offer their own assessments there is little chance that the united states given the difficult lessons of its wars in iraq and afghanistan will embark on a major invasion and military occupation any time soon but if it did the ineptness and hubris of the u s led reconstruction effort will serve as a guide to how it should not be done the level of fraud waste and abuse in iraq was appalling sen susan collins r maine told sigir she said she had urged the white house to make careful loans to iraq for reconstruction but bush had insisted on a no strings attached approach instead a senior iraqi bank auditor dr abdul basit turki al sae ed who has led many investigations of iraqi government spending said the flood of u s dollars into the country had fostered a triangle of political patronage among iraq political parties sectarian groups and government officials that sparked corruption and terrorism former iraqi prime minister ibrahim al ja afari said iraq oil profits which in 2003 and 2004 were spent by bremer cpa were gravely mismanaged eroding the country educational and medical facilities and sapping its ability to provide such basics as electricity u s army chief of staff odierno who commanded in iraq for six of the war nine years said in retrospect it would have been better to have held off major u s investments in reconstruction projects until five or six years into the war when u s troops and u s trained and equipped iraqi forces were beginning to bring the violence under control in 2004 for instance the u s launched an ambitious project to build a sewer and water system in fallujah a center of intense and bloody sectarian fighting originally slated to cost 35 million and take 18 months to complete the project so far has cost 195 million and is scheduled to be finished in 2014 raheem al ugaili a judge and head of iraq commission on public integrity until 2011 pursued dozens of corruption investigations involving u s funded projects until he was fired for reaching too deeply into iraq political elite vast amounts of money were wasted without attaining actual intended results al ugaili told sigir he identified one major problem common to u s reconstruction efforts americans excluded iraqis from the planning and prioritizing of projects but worse than simply wasted money and incomplete projects was the culture of corruption left behind sketching out a grim picture of iraq anti corruption institutions in full retreat the judge asserted that the level of kickbacks to iraq government officials and the volume of money laundering continue to grow sigir reports that culture has seeped into the u s involvement in afghanistan as well according to ryan crocker who served as ambassador to afghanistan from 2011 to 2012 after leading the political military campaign in iraq from 2007 to 2009 with petraeus corruption cost over runs and unfinished construction of u s funded projects in afghanistan are documented in regular reports from the u s special inspector general for afghan reconstruction sigar also a congressionally mandated watchdog crocker told sigar that the united states had done a better job in afghanistan in including local afghans in the planning process but as in iraq he said the united states had launched ambitious projects for which afghans had neither the expertise nor the money to operate for instance he said afghanistan lacks the money to maintain the new road system built with reconstruction funds we are already seeing them crumbling he said',\n"," 'my daughter is six and has adhd they

is a good man and we had a great sex life our first 2 years together we have been together 5 years and we hardly ever fight i am happier than i have every been and feel lucky to have my life however lately i am having issues with him wanting sex more than i do i want to be the one to initiate sometimes and that never happens i usually end up giving in just so he will leave me alone sometimes and that just is not right i do like sex and he is a loving and caring partner that is not the issue the biggest issue i think is that he is younger and i have issues with getting him to help more around the house i work more than he does i take care of all the bills i manage his business and mine and i have to remind him to do all the things he is supposed to me doing which most of the time i end up doing i am exhausted most of the time the house is a mess because i dont have time and he is supposed to do it but it gets so bad to the point i can not have people over or have no dishes and am drinking out of tupperware bowls because we have no clean glasses i have a hard time living in an environment that is so messy and chaotic i literally want to go stay in a hotel sometimes he will wait until the dishes are so bad that we have maggots in the sink before he will get to them sometimes our car engine blew up because he never kept up with the maintance and i had to deal with getting that fixed i spend my only time off cleaning i ask him for help i tried making task lists i tried giving him space i have tried everything and nothing seems to work i try to have him help with simple things like errands but he feels if he does one thing for the day he is done he can not multi task to save his life he works comes home and gets on hist computer or his xbox and plays games this is the only thing he likes to do so i do not want to take that away from him since he always comes home to me and isnt out at clubs or with his friends all the time like some husbands but i just wish he would spend 2 hours day helping me most of this is my fault i enabled him because i had more experience than running a house and a business so i did just take over these things naturally so i think he is just used to me doing everything when i tried to get him to help he just could not get into the groove i guess and i probably was a little rough on him because he was not doing things right i almost relate it to how i felt as a teenager when mom gave you choirs and you shirked them because you knew in the end she would do them or she would just take over because you were not doing them right i struggle with trying to get him to learn how i had to learn when i was on my own and became responsible i am not sure how to get him there that is an ongoing struggle the biggest problem now is that it has affected our sex life he wants sex from me daily and i get so annoyed because i feel like it is just one more thing i have to do like another job or another task i have no control of i resent him for not helping me more and have told him if he helped me more i would feel more in the mood in fact when i seem him take initiative it makes me look at him differently and i want to have sex with him i give him lots of affection even initiating sex when he is in the middle of a choir hoping to inspire him more i have expressed to him that his lack of help is affecting me physically and mentally 3 months ago i ended up having to get 45 stitches in my hand because he did not help me move something so when i tried i got hurt he felt awful and for a short time seemed to snap out of it but it did not take long for him to go back to his old ways he loves me and i know if he really understood that it hurts me he is not helping that he would step up i have told him this is what is

crescendo of high pitch there is no pattern to it walking or laying down makes no difference there is no position where there is relief i do not like to take pain pills they upset my stomach but had a few loratabs left from a dental problem they lowered the volume but still the pain was intense my family doctor referred me to an orthopedic surgeon and prescribed percocet until my appointment same

stops those areas have different types of pain but both radiate from the knee 2 days ago i woke up and a brown bruise about the size of a quarter was on the side of my knee cap it not a bad bruise but there are 2 black dots about half inch apart inside of the bruise they look like small punctures sort of like you get with a shot today i saw the specialist i have used him before for a frozen shoulder and had excellent results with a cortisone type injection in the shoulder joint he took a few images and could not see a problem then he spent about 20 minutes checking all the pressure points he explained that certain points when pressed would indicate the problem and that i would not be able to stand his touching it nothing hurt any worse when he pressed but the pain was already severe when i did not react he checked them again and was puzzled by my lack of reaction when he saw the bruise he questioned me at length about how it got there when i finally made him understand it just came there while i was asleep he said he would never seen anything like that i asked if there was something leaking from under the kneecap and he said no he said that without further tests he could not tell what was wrong he said this was the first time in his career he had seen a patient be in such pain without responding when the pressure point was pressed i asked him about tests and he said an mri without explanation that is out for me i asked for a cortisone shot and he agreed to try it but said it might take as long as 72 hours to feel the full effect he did not come right out and say it but he did not appear to think it would do much good but would not hurt to try has anyone here had a similar problem or know of something i can ask him to check thanks in advance for any

he needs to take his medicine or watch what he eats in 2003 he had his first stroke after basically eating the whole pie of papa john pizza we thought that would be his reality check guess what it was

blood pressure high cholesterol and arthritis he refuses to believe that his stroke was caused by anything else besides diabetes he has also suffered from depression for years even before the stroke

otherwise except for buttons his teacher says that his fine motor skills are a bit weak and he just needs help strengthening his hands she suggested using play doh hiding something small inside and getting him to dig it out make things like letters numbers and shapes with it etc now she handing out zipper licenses in class to the children who can do up their zippers independently and so we have been working with our son to help him master this skill he made some progress in that he can now place his hands in the correct spots for manoeuvering the zipper into the right spot but although he can pull the zipper up fine he can not start it by himself he has always been a bit slow in figuring these things out but he always does so i am not deeply concerned about it i just wonder if anyone

probably should have went to the er following my return home upon awaking the next day i had a severe crushing headache with pressure four weeks after this incident i have sensations of vertigo when moving my head side to side up or down or bouncing my head such as when i run it as if my eyes can not follow along with my head standing up after i have been sitting also creates this vertigo effect the vertigo also creates an unsteadiness to my balance i have also noticed a feeling of pressure in the upper inside corners of both my eyes and discomfort moving my eyes from side to side this vertigo has all but put a hold on my exercise as any head movement triggers the sensation also of note i assume as a side effect of the extreme heat exhaustion i appear to have become heat intolerant any exposure to stagnant heat even without exercise and my heart rate shoots the roof along with associated dizziness during these episodes i just can not get my heart rate to come down and must quickly get into an air condtioned building almost called 911 as one time i nearly fainted being i have never felt any of these symptoms before i fear the severe heat exhaustion exertion has caused

was normal he recommended i see an ent specialist could this be something vascular that occured in the brain that was not picked up on the mri could severe dehydration heat exhaustion trigger these

book of revelation which comes last in the new testament describes this conclusion in vivid language that has inspired christians for centuries but few churches are willing to set a date for the end of the world heeding jesus words in the gospels of mark and matthew that no one can know the day or hour it will happen predictions like camping though are not new one of the most famous in history was by the baptist leader william miller who predicted the end for oct 22 1844 which came to be known as the great disappointment among his followers some of who subsequently founded the seventh day

old step daughter has been without her mother for the last couple of years she just upped and left her to her father i have been apart of her life for 4 years now and have been in a relationship with her father for 2 she was a very smart and independent child before being removed from the home by facs when she was 3 because of her mother we have won our custody battle and she has been home with us for 9 months now speaking with her foster mom i find that my boyfriend and i are having the same problems the foster mom was having with her she is constantly mouthing off to everybody she would rather play alone than with anybody else she gets very physical with objects that are around her when she does not get her way just last week she had a spelling test and she did not feel like it so she took her shoes off and began to throw them around the classroom she is peeing and pooping her pants on a daily basis sometimes 4 5 times a day last week as well she got up at 3 00am and sat in the middle of her floor we told her that she needed to be in her bed because she had school in the morning and she needed her rest so that she could be awake to play the next day she refused her father had to scoop her up off the floor and put her in her bed and even getting her head down on the pillow was a hassle she woke her 1 year old sister up in the process although she has yet to harm her younger sister in a huge manor i am afraid that she may or even hurt herself the foster mom had told us that she used to have to hold her down because she would get so violent she has and still is in psychiatry and play theory but nobody seems to have an answer other than anxiety to me this seems to be more than anxiety there is a history of bi polar in her family and they are looking out for it but they say that it is very highly unlikely i have mentioned to them odd and they gave me no response to this they just changed the subject she not eating her meals so i make sure to give her a vitamin every day so that she still gets the nutrition she needs i have tried every discipline in the book i have had facs public health and councilors give me advice and i have taken it but none of it is working as for her peeing and pooping herself i have also taken her to the doctors for that to see if it was a medical problem and the results came back negative it seems to me too that she likes to cause problems the way that i explained it to her psychiatrist is that she has just lit a village on fire and she sitting at the highest hilltop and watching everybody run for their lives i saw one day that her father and i had got into an argument about how to deal with this situation and she sat on the couch watching us with a smile on her face to me this seems defiant it almost like she purposely trying to cause problems or maybe she just trying to pry her father and i apart whatever the case may be something has to give my patience is wearing thin and i try to be considerate of her situation but i can only be considerate so much before she takes advantage of it i do not really know what to do and i think i could better cope and communicate with her better if i could find out

coughed from november till march everytime the coughs would get bad is when he would vomit he actually figured out a way to cough without it hurting him so much he was given tylenol w codeine to stop

socket without getting bruised so typically i go to the emergency room thinking this is way different than the normal pink eye or ulcers and it wasnt even painful which was my other concern after like a nice 5 hour wait im told i have pink eye they didnt swab my eye do tests or anything they only made me read a board across the room without my glasses on well i was very unsure of the answer they gave me but went home took the meds they gave me and nothing worked after about 4 months the swelling stopped my eye went back to normal and i was able to wear contacts again so i get a new doctor new

semi submersible ocean going craft and weighs 1000 tons it has a total height of 51 meters with 31 meters below sea level it is designed to float vertically and drift with the ocean currents but has two small propellers allowing it to modify its trajectory and maneuver in confined waters underwater robots can be sent from the laboratory to explore the seabed the hull is made ã ã of an alloy comprising aluminum and magnesium is five times thicker than that of a conventional vessel its vertical alignment in the sea will leave a small part visible above the surface with much larger

thatã s really insurance ã says paul fronstin director of the health research program at the employee benefits research institute ã œthey may not cover prescription drugs and if you get cancer or end up in the hospital they probably wonã t help you a whole lot ã insurance offered under the affordable care act by contrast could end up being a much better deal obamacare is complicated and it will require many people to do detailed research on their insurance options instead of having an employer do it for them there have also been elaborate efforts by foes of the program to depict it as the ruination of everything so itã s not surprising that part timers being told their employer is cutting them loose and sending them over to obamacare are a little jumpy actually enrolling could calm them down however obamacare was designed to make decent health insurance affordable for people who otherwise canã t afford it and whether you love or hate the program it seems likely to succeed at that basic mission thatã s because the program subsidizes the cost of insurance based on your income with the largest subsidies going to those with the lowest incomes lots of confusionthere are many insurance choices under obamacare that vary by state and apply to different income levels which adds to the confusion but the nonprofit kaiser family foundation has built a helpful calculator that lets you enter your income and a few other basic details to get an idea of how much insurance would cost you under the program a single parent with three kids and an annual income of 25 000 for instance could get an 8 800 insurance plan for a total out of pocket cost of 500 per year subsidies in other words cover 94 of the cost try to beat that on part time pay a two parent family with two kids and a 50 000 income could get a 10 000 plan for 3 365 with subsidies covering 66 of the cost thereã s one catch you only qualify for such deals if youã re not able to get coverage through your employer so if youã re a part timer whose company canceled your watered down insurance coverage it may have actually done you a favor trader joeã s is one employer known for offering generous health care benefits even for part timers until now but even those workers could end up better off under obamacare in an internal email published by the washington post a trader joeã s exec provided some calculations for a part time employee who earns about 24 000 per year and has been paying about 167 per month as her share of a trader joeã s policy similar to a ã œsilverã plan under the aca if she enrolls in obamacare the subsidized cost would fall to about 70 per month for nearly identical coverage and thatã s before a 500 annual stipend trader joeã s plan to offer part timers to help them pay for insurance some will pay morewithout a doubt there will be some people who end up paying more for insurance as their employers offer less mostly they will be higher income workers who lose employer provided coverage and have to buy it through obamacare subsidies are phased out at 400 of the poverty line which this year is 45 960 for an individual and 94 200 for a family of 4 above that people have to pay the full cost of coverage other companies have been changing their health care coverage in ways that sound like theyã re related to obamacare but arenã t walgreens wag for instance will begin requiring employees to choose an insurance plan from a private ã œexchangeã that offers at least 25 choices instead of the three or four walgreenã s has been offering the concept is similar to the public exchanges that will be up and running under obamacare beginning october 1 with coverage beginning january 1 but the government plays no role and offers no subsidies in the exchange walgreenã s is joining walgreenã s will still bear much of the cost of its employeesã coverage through fixed stipends it grants employees to help pay for care but workers will now have to educate themselves more choose coverage from a wide range of options and pay the difference if they choose cadillac coverage that costs more than the subsidy covers the idea is to give employees a stronger incentive to control health care spending by requiring them to pay more of their own money as costs rise ibm ibm time warner twx and general electric ge have enacted similar plans for retirees and companies in general are getting more aggressive about finding new ways to control health care spending as it become more and more of a burden obamacare may be part of the solution but many companies would be doing this even without the health reform law if the scaremongering over obamacare ever stops weathering changes in health care benefits may no longer require hypertension medication',\n","

2 messages am very worried on last sonogram there is a small nodule of about 1 centimeter the said they can not tell if its a polyp or a fibroid it location is in the canal which i think is close to the cervix this is in addition to 4 fibroids that were found 1 year go there were 2 fibroids and 2 years ago there was 1 the largest one is 3cm up from 2 5 last year there a combination of subserserosal and submucosal although for most people the gyn would recommend an endometrial biopsy she is trying to spare me and get more info first she says iget too much pain with just the speculum and she does not think i would be able to tolerate it i think she just doesnt want a rough day she would prefer i would have a d c under general but i do not want this anyway she says maybe a transvaginal sonogram would be able to tell whether the nodule was a polyp or fibroid i only had the regular pelvic transabdominal one so far but is this really true i thought it is very hard to tell the differece between polyp and fibroidif you have a small one which is submucosal even on transvaginal exam another words i do not know ifit would help at all i would rather not waste time energy and discomfort and cleanliness issues if its useless i am not sexually active right now and think it would be painful and difficult i did one years ago and hated it the report did notinclude the thickness of the endometrial liining though did say the rest of the endometrium looked normal i have plenty of symptoms periods are very heavy am anemic they last at least7 days and are coming every 24 days i am 50 years old so likely just another 2 years of this but besides the nodule these are also symptoms of endometrial canncer if one were being careful they would do more invasive tests but again biopsies and threading things thru catheter thru my cervix i am tryingto avoid because of general health issue eventually i may not be able to avoid it back to question does anyone know if transvaginal us really might be able to tell the difference given how hard they are to disinguish or am i just wasting precious energy time thanks',\n"," 'i have been on the pill for 8 years i was

posting since i had my ep on the 3rd of sept i was 8 weeks gone i had to have my right tube removed along with the pregnancy recovery has been kind in that my stitches have healed well no major pains other than ovulation type pains on both sides which i can control with painkillers slowly i have gained my energy back and ready to go back to work on monday i dont feel any particular emotional loss to the ep other than saddened it had to happen i am keep to start trying again and as such have become addicted to sites such as this with uplifting success storied from other ladies i have not bleed other than two days of very light spotting post surgery so am waiting for af to arrive the thing is i am just fed up twisted twisted twisted does anyone else feel this way i have spent the past three weeks trying to figure out what could have caused the ep i have had a chlamydia test done and am awaiting results i have thought back to the past year to locate any pelvic discomfort or pain as a reason i guess i am trying to figure out not only what caused it but how i can prevent it patience is not something i have much of so waiting 3 months is driving me insane i am hoping work will help distract my counting the days the things is i feel as if i am so alone though i am not alone at all as if there is no one who really understands or cares enough to ask my husband seems to be carrying on as normal i have read many womens partners and husbands have done the same that it is their way of coping i feel as if he is being rather inconsiderate of what i have gone through his lack of knowledge ignorance of the procedure or my recovery his ability to think i can be ok to think his about his work as so important he has even gone so far as to make comments about my recovery as if i am faking or exaggerating it he made out his comment was a joke am i being too sensitive he made some statement the other night how his work is going to be stressful and be the death of him and i needed to be considerate and give him the time he needs i feel that is all i have given him with our whole marriage to cut that story short i have been the one that has got the ball rolling on the engagement and wedding 17 4 9 of which i am still waiting on the honeymoon we had planned to start ttc after our honeymoon but it honeymoon never happened because of his work or something then we fell pregnant and then the ep so now i asked him to get the honeymoon sorted as it would be a nice break for us and he has done nothing to boot he has now told me he has alot of stress at work am i being rather insensitive about his stress at work with all the engagement wedding honeymoon saga over the past year i have asked myself if he is right for me and now this ep is making me ask it again i know you guys can not answer for me but i wonder if anyone else had these thoughts i feel as if i had to go through and do it all and he gets away with nothing carrying on with life as if nothing has happened it not as if these thoughts have come later on either i started feeling them soon after my ep was removed it is all so confusing as i am aware i could be focusing all my ep emotions onto him and taking it out on him does it sound like i am doing that i am hoping sitting at home has exacerbated all my thoughts and going back to work will do me the world of good the one thing we are both agreeing on is ttc as soon as we can i have had conflicting advice on whent o start but am waiting to see how af is when she arrives i have not had a bad recovery post op so i hope she will be kind

periods have been late each month i think max was about 3 4 days but always neg tests think eyes were playing tricks thinking it could be pos so this time i was due sept 26th making me 9 days late and no signs of turning up i done a test yesterday and it kinda looked v faint pos so i thought here we go again and waited til today this one seems darker but still faint i had a bleed on 14th thru til about 17th none 16th i have had bleeding when i was preg before but that was when i knew i was but what im a little confused on is could the 14th of been a weird period and i got preg after that and

tired all of a sudden and need to sleep whereas before was just constant low energy i know i should go gp but i went so much before i want to be sure this time i guess can a digi test that says preg

border city of kaesong heard on morning edition the reaction came amid rising tensions after an investigative report concluded that north korea was to blame for sinking a south korean naval vessel in march killing 46 sailors south korea on tuesday resumed propaganda broadcasts across the north south border the north has threatened to fire artillery shells at south korean loudspeakers used in the broadcasts pyongyang also said it will resume its own broadcasts reports also said the north had ordered its military on high alert and that south korean ships and aircraft would be prohibited from passing through its territory restrictions on trade travelin addition to taking its complaint against north korea to the u n security council south korean president lee myung bak said monday that his country would cut off much of its trade with the north lee also said north korean merchant vessels will no longer be allowed to use a shortcut through south korean waters a move that would force the north korean ships to expend more time and fuel but analysts say the measures wo not be enough to change the north behavior an international investigation found that the explosion of the south korean warship cheonan on march 26 was caused by a torpedo launched from a north korean submarine north korea has denied any involvement in the sinking and said it would treat the south retaliatory measures

in anti submarine warfare exercises in the near future given north korea bellicose statements so far it not clear how its military would react in a confrontation at sea i think everybody trying to get the mix just right says thomas hubbard a former u s ambassador to south korea to have measures that are strong enough to teach a lesson but not so strong as to create a retaliatory cycle will sanctions hurt north korea north korea exports minerals such as construction sand and some farm products to the south the loss of that trade could amount to more than 250 million a year that

burns a north korean flag with an image of north korean leader kim jong il during a rally in seoul on tuesday south korea has imposed trade sanctions on the north for alleged sinking a southern naval vessel that enough to have an impact on north korea economy says analyst jack pritchard but it wo not be a decisive impact even so pritchard the president of the korea economic institute in washington says the sanctions are a necessary step to express south korean anger over the attack pritchard says the south action leaves north korea in a weaker position with little trade beyond what it has with its major trading partner china north korea trade with the south was a source of foreign exchange currency which the north then used to buy items such as fuel and machinery from china commodities that

probably take up much of the slack caused by the south korean trade cutoff both china and south korea view the north as an important source of low cost labor one major exception to the trade cutoff is the kaesong industrial complex an area in north korea where more than a dozen south korean companies have built or are building manufacturing plants to be staffed by north korean workers activity at

million a year in hard currency wages south korean economists believe it could eventually employ more than 700 000 north korean workers hubbard says south korea would be reluctant to shut the project down more than trade the south koreans see this as laying the basis for future relations hubbard says he adds that if the kaesong complex were shut down the loss of jobs would very likely stir a strong public reaction that even the north korean leadership would have to pay attention to one thing that not clear to economists is how much criminal activity contributes to north korea economy according to the u s state department north korea is also thought to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the unreported sale of missiles narcotics and counterfeit cigarettes and currency',\n","

'http lifeinc today com _news 2013 04 23 17880268 rich got richer during the recovery and rest got poorer study says lite the nationã s richest american households generally gained wealth during the first two years of the economic recovery a new research report finds while most american households saw their net worth drop the report released tuesday by the pew research center found that the mean net worth for the 7 percent of american households at the top of the wealth distribution rose by 28 percent between 2009 and 2011 the most recent data available meanwhile the mean net worth for the other 93 percent of american households fell by 4 percent during that period according to pewã s analysis of census data overall the aggregate net worth for all american households rose between 2009 and 2011 but pewã s more detailed analysis showed that the gains were concentrated among the wealthiest americans and the wealth gap increased during that time economists say thatã s a continuation of a trend toward more wealth being found at the top of the income scale ã œthereã s been a growing concentration of wealth in this country for quite a while now and itã s just really accelerated in the last really 15 years ã said joel naroff chief economist with naroff economic advisors who was not involved in the pew study the great recession officially ran from december of 2007 to june of 2009 but the recovery since that time has been weak and uneven the pew researchers said rallies in stocks and bonds which benefited affluent households with major investments largely drove the discrepancy in wealth gains during those two years the housing market where many other americans derive a lot of their wealth did not do that well during that period the pew researchers said they focused on the top 7 percent of the wealth distribution because that was the tabulation available from the census data the report found that the mean net wealth for those 8 million households rose to around 3 17 million in 2011 from approximately 2 48 million in 2009 for the other approximately 111 million households mean net worth fell to nearly 134 000 in 2011 from nearly 140 000 in 2009 the reportã s authors note that some less wealthy american households no doubt saw wealth gains during the period in general however more of the households in that 93 percent saw their wealth fall rather than rise naroff noted that income distribution is always shifting in one way or another but the wealth gap has grown especially wide in recent years that could pose problems for an economy that is largely driven by consumer spending ã œwe havenã t seen it at least in 100 years as heavily distributed to the upper income side as weã re seeing now and we donã t know whether that pattern is readily reversed ã he said ã œand if itã s not reversed what happens to the economy thatã s built on a consumer base thatã s the uncertainty that we have ã i was going to add this onto ms p banking thread but i thought it deserved its own',\n"," 'eight days ago i started having white flashes and floaters appear in my right eye which my dr said are from a painless migraine of the eye my vision is blurry like i am

from an overnight stay with her father we met up with our daughter within the hour as we had arranged to go out for a meal with them on seeing them i noted that our little granddaughters hair did not looked brushed and she looked shattered she greeted me as she always does with open arms and a big kiss then she begun to cry all evening she was very subdued pale and then she called mum at the table tinky you are stinky this is not a term we use at all especially directed at anyone and in such a tone i babysat her that week on the mon wed and thurs all three nights were very distressing refusing to do anything and everything hand in mouth hiding under the stairs looking very frightened to come out hiding under the breakfast bar on the wednesday and crying and looking scared and wary and then after a long period of about 30 mins would break down apologising for being bad saying sorry when it is not appropriate lashing out and kicking refusing to get undressed at bedtime in the mornings refusing to get dressed speaking in an ugly manner and shouting screwing up her face during all of this throwing her bedtime books all over the floor refusing bedtime stories not letting us brush her hair pushing the mirror off the dressing table do not this and do not want that pointing into my face and her own and then pointing between her legs when i offered no response she did it again her expression was hard to read i told her i did not understand she just run off being aggressive with the pets we have a dog and a cat being aggressive with us on the following sat we had tickets to go see sleeping beauty she has been before on this occasion her spark had gone gone from being a happy animated child to a zombie this all happened within one week the second and third week was just as eventful we contacted gateway a social welfare network for protecting children they advised no contact with the father and that it would be investigated 4 weeks later they sent a very young girl to assess our little granddaughter she only has had one one hr assessment to date by this time emma was having good spells meantime the fathers father took mum to court to resume access despite mum explaining to father the change in her behaviour the judge held mum in contempt of court and a summons would be issued if she stopped contact and jail the report provided by the social worker from gateway summed it up as borderline and basically made it look like its just a petty feud between parents visitation was reinstated my daughter begged for supervision supervision was granted by the court but only by any member of his family which defeated the purpose of the whole supervision request the whole experience has been gutt wrenching our solicitor did not prepare us for anything when the application for court was received by the fathers solicitor the only advice he could offer was that that was foolish for them to do that and that we would just have to go with it we have contacted a psychologist privately we have changed solicitors we have so far felt let down by the system i can understand now how children can be open to abuse as the lack of interest in the social care is amazing this is now march and still no more word about assessments which was promised also they said that there would be no access while assessments were done however when court contacted them by phone the social worker who did the one assessment felt that the father posed no threat based on one visit our granddaughter has changed dramatically lost her confidence her spark her warm loving embraces are now few since visitation started back last saturday the drama has returned there have been 2 visits since the court date on both those dates on returning our grandddaughter displays alot of aggression hatred namecalling and lashing out does this really sound like a family feud if my spelling and grammar have deteriorated its because i am weary mother is so much distressed too she does not know where to turn she is started counselling with lifeline to keep her head throughout this ordeal i do know that creche say she talks about us all the time fondly about all the antics we get up to they report this daily to us i know she does this at her fathers or wherever she goes but oddly we never hear anything much from her about fathers side of the family about what she does a member of staff at the creche did disclose to me that she has only mentioned her dads name recently my question is this what help is there out there for us will the psychologist shine some light she is only 3

position of my eyes changed and my strabismus eye was now going cross eyed thus the seeing 2 a total of 7 surgeries later between the 2 eyes with the most recent 6 weeks ago my problem has

step in fixing my problem to add to the problem i was now at reading glasses stage and i essentially ended up with monovision and monovision does not work when you have strabismus so that caused yet another problem that is my surgeon performed lasik on the eye to correct the 1 and my off balance feeling is gone and my eyes seem to be back to their old albeit 8 years ago position so essentially my
